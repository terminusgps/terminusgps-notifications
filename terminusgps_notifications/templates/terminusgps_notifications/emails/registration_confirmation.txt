Hey, {{ first_name|default_if_none:'there' }}!

Thanks for registering your new [Terminus GPS Notifications]({{ link_homepage }}) account!

To get started delivering live notifications to your end-users, you need to do a few more things:

- Add a [payment method]({{ link_account }}).
- Add a [shipping address]({{ link_account }}).
- [Connect]({{ link_account }}) your Wialon account.
- [Subscribe]({{ link_subscription }}).
- [Create]({{ link_notifications }}) a new notification.

You can do all of that from your [dashboard]({{ link_dashboard }}).

We look forward to working with you!

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reply to this email (we promise it'll make it to our support team).
